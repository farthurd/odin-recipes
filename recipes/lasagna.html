    <em>Freshly baked lasagna out of the oven</em>

    <p>
        Lasagne is an Italian casserole prepared with thin pasta sheets of approximately 10 by 15 cm. In Dutch these sheets are called lasagna sheets, in Italian they are referred to as lasagne (plural). Sometimes the complete dish is also referred to by this term in Italian, or lasagne al forno (sheets from the oven ). Although lasagna is a typical Italian dish, its name comes from Greece , where "lasanon" means flat cake of dough .
